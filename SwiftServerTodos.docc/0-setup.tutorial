        Ensure you have the right tools and example code before learning how to write your Swift server application.

            To start the tutorial you need to have compatible versions of Swift, Git, and Docker Compose installed.

            Follow the steps below to verify your installed software and if necessary update or install to the latest version. 
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                **Run** `% swift --version` 

                Verify you have Swift version 6.1 or later installed. If not, upgrade now.  Instructions to install Swift can be found at [swift.org/install](http://swift.org/install).

                @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "0-bash.0.txt")
            }

            @Step {
                **Run** `% git --version`
                
                You will use `% git clone` to clone the repository accompanying this tutorial.
                Instructions to install `git` can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

                @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "0-bash.1.txt")
            }

            @Step {
                **Run** `% docker compose version`
                
                This tutorial requires you to run containers that adhere to the [compose specification](https://www.compose-spec.io).
                Docker Desktop installation steps can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

                @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "0-bash.2.txt")
            }
        }
    }

    @Section(title: "Clone and build the tutorial repository") {
        @ContentAndMedia {            
            A sample repository was created to simplify the examples in this tutorial.
            To complete your setup, youâ€™ll clone and build the repository.
        }

        @Steps {
            @Step {
                **Run** `% git clone`

                Use the URL provided on the right to clone the tutorial repo.

                @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "0-bash.2.0.txt")
            }

            @Step {
                **Run** `% cd swift-server-todos-tutorial`
                
                Navigate to the directory that was cloned.

                @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "0-bash.2.1.txt")
            }

            @Step {
                **Run** `% swift build --product SwiftServerTodos`
                
                `swift build --product` leverages the Swift Package Manager to fetch all the dependencies and build an executable binary for the product you specify.
                This can take a minute or two.

                @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "0-bash.2.2.txt")
            }

            @Step {
                **Run** `% swift build --product SwiftServerTodos --show-bin-path`
                
                The --show-bin-path switch returns the path of the binary that swift build produced.

                @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "0-bash.2.3.txt")
            }

            @Step {
                **Run** `% ls .build/debug/SwiftServerTodos`
                
                This verifies that the executable binary was built and that you are ready to start the tutorial!

                @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "0-bash.2.4.txt")
            }
        }
}
